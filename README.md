Predicting High Sales for a New Dish using KMeans Clustering
This is a Python code that uses KMeans clustering to predict whether a new dish will have high sales based on its price and cost. The code is built using the scikit-learn library and the Intel Optimized KMeans algorithm, which is provided through the Sklearnex module from Intel.

Dataset
The dataset used in this code is named "food.csv" and contains information about different dishes served at a restaurant, including the price of the food, the cost of making the food, and the number of dishes sold. The aim of this code is to predict whether a new dish will have high sales based on its price and cost.

Code
The Python code is structured as follows:

1.Load the food dataset using Pandas and select the features for clustering
2.Scale the features to a range of 0 to 1 using MinMaxScaler
3.Use the Intel optimized version of KMeans to cluster the data into 2 clusters
4.Predict the cluster labels for the original data and add them back to the original dataset
5.Identify the cluster with higher average sales
6.Predict high sales for a new dish with a given price and cost

Intel Optimized KMeans
The Intel Optimized KMeans algorithm provides faster performance and better scalability compared to the standard scikit-learn KMeans algorithm. It achieves this by using the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) to optimize the computations performed by the algorithm. The Sklearnex module from Intel provides a simple way to use the Intel Optimized KMeans algorithm in Python code.

To use the Intel Optimized KMeans algorithm in this code, we first patch the scikit-learn library with the patch_sklearn() function from the Sklearnex module. We then use the KMeans() function from scikit-learn to create a KMeans model and set the algorithm parameter to 'full', which tells scikit-learn to use the Intel Optimized KMeans algorithm.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this code demonstrates how KMeans clustering can be used to predict high sales for a new dish based on its price and cost. By using the Intel Optimized KMeans algorithm provided through the Sklearnex module from Intel, we can achieve faster performance and better scalability compared to the standard scikit-learn KMeans algorithm.
